## About Survivle.app:

  Taking inspiration from Wordle and Squabble, Survivle tests your word solving skills while doing so under time pressure.
  Each word is randomly pulled from a dictionary list and all the words consist of 5 letters. While you attempt to solve words, you battle to stay alive by healing damage when you correctly guess words or letters (see " How To Play " for more information).


## How To Play:

Go to: https://www.survivle.app/

* Keep guessing words until you have correctly guessed 6 of them or your health points (HP) run out!
* You lose 1 HP every second and lose 20 HP when you miss a word within 6 tries.
* You heal 1 HP for every letter found and heal 20 HP when you correctly guess a word.
* Yellow letters indicate that the letter is in the word but in a different position.
* Green letters indicate that the letter is in the correct position.
